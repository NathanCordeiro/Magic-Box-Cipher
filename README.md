# Magic Box Cipher
---

## Overview
The MagicBox cipher is my own take on the classic keyword substitution cipher.  This type of cipher relies on a secret keyword to create a custom codebook for encryption and decryption. While there are many historical and existing keyword ciphers, the MagicBox cipher offers a unique twist with its approach.
